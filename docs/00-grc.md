# Thuso Medical Assistant – Risk Analysis and Mitigation Framework 

## 1. Clinical Safety Risks
#### Risk: 
Users misinterpret guidance as medical advice, delaying necessary care.
#### Mitigation:
Conservative triage, mandatory red-flag escalation, repeated disclaimers, safety-first UX design. 

#### Risk:
Disagreement among clinicians causing confusion or harm.

#### Mitigation:
Clinician-only raw discussion, moderated summaries, conflict-resolution protocol.

## 2. Legal & Regulatory Risks
#### Risk:
Platform treated as a telemedicine provider without appropriate
licensing.

#### Mitigation:
Clear boundaries: educational-only content, no diagnosis/prescription,
jurisdiction-specific compliance. 

#### Risk: 
Liability for clinician or platform errors.
#### Mitigation:
Terms of service, clinician indemnity rules, audit trails, disclaimers. 

## 3. Privacy & Data Protection Risks
#### Risk: 
Re-identification of “anonymised” cases.

#### Mitigation: 
Strong de-identification, aggregation, privacy review, optional synthetic cases. 

#### Risk:
Sensitive clinician discussions being leaked.

#### Mitigation:
Access controls, encryption, separate internal workspace. 

## 4. Ethical Risks: 
#### Risk:
Coercive incentives for users to share information.
#### Mitigation:
Voluntary opt-in, transparent informed consent, non-monetary rewards. 

#### Risk: 
Biased clinician participation.
Mitigation: Balanced recruitment, moderator checks, clinical governance board. 

## 5. Operational Risks
#### Risk:
Moderation load becoming unsustainable.
#### Mitigation:
Scalable SOPs, combination of human + automated checks.
#### Risk: 
Inconsistent quality of clinical summaries.
#### Mitigation:
Standardised templates, editor review, periodic audits. 

## 6. Technical Risks:
#### Risk:
Platform security breaches.
#### Mitigation:
Encryption, access logs, least privilege architecture.
#### Risk:
Poor versioning of clinician commentary.
#### Mitigation:
Immutable logs, version tracking.

## 7. Aggregated Risk Mitigation Strategy
- Strong governance board (clinical, legal, ethics).
- Clear scope: educational, not diagnostic.
- Robust triage and red-flag protections.
- Rigorous privacy-by-design approach.
- Pilot deployment and iteration.
