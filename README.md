# Thuso Medical Assistant – Product Concept

Thuso Medical Assistant is a smart, accessible health-education companion designed for communities where timely access to healthcare isn’t always guaranteed. It helps people understand their symptoms, learn when to take action, and gain clarity about their health whether on WhatsApp or via a dedicated web platform.

## For Clients

Thuso guides users through a simple, conversational history-taking experience on WhatsApp or the web. By answering a few focused questions, users receive:

- Clear, easy-to-understand explanations of what their symptoms could mean

- Red-flag alerts highlighting when they need urgent medical attention

- Educational insights into related conditions, self-care principles, and risk factors

On the web platform, users can also browse a growing library of public health cases, including real anonymised scenarios and insights about common or endemic conditions. This empowers people with practical, community-relevant knowledge and promotes informed decision-making.

## For the Medical Community

Thuso creates a unique, moderated space for registered clinicians to exchange insights, discuss anonymised cases, and contribute to community health education. Practitioners can:

- Engage with anonymised cases contributed by users

- Offer evidence-informed perspective in a structured, respectful environment

- Help shape public summaries that improve health literacy

- Contribute to community awareness on important local conditions

- Build visibility and professional impact while helping the public navigate health concerns

All clinician discussions remain private and professionally moderated, ensuring safety, accuracy, and trust. Only clear, balanced, and patient-friendly summaries are shared publicly.

## The Value

Thuso bridges the gap between healthcare access and health understanding. It gives users clarity when they need it most, while enabling the medical community to uplift public health through collaborative insight without the barriers of cost, distance, or clinic queues.


# Thuso Medical Assistant - Core concepts

Thuso Medical Assistant is built on the understanding that while we always encourage individuals to seek timely medical care from registered medical practitioners, this is not always feasible in real-world circumstances. In such situations, providing people with a clearer understanding of what might be happening, what could potentially go wrong, and the possible consequences of delaying formal care can be valuable.

Even after a clinical consultation, many clients still experience gaps in understanding their condition, its management, and the range of possible diagnoses or treatment options. As clinicians, we recognise that medicine often involves working and differential diagnoses; definitive answers are not always attainable at first contact. In this context, informed community discourse among qualified practitioners can provide helpful perspectives and support patient understanding.

However, professional discussions naturally involve differing opinions, which—if shared directly with clients—may create confusion or misinterpretation. To manage this responsibly, Thuso will facilitate moderated professional discourse governed by a clear code of conduct aligned with existing medical ethical standards. This ensures that disagreements are handled constructively, the reputations of clinicians are safeguarded, and the information ultimately communicated to clients is accurate, contextualised, and ethically appropriate. Because of this, practitioner discussions and commentary constitute sensitive information that must be treated with care.

From a practitioner perspective, Thuso offers an opportunity to engage with the wider community, gain visibility, exchange insights with colleagues, and contribute to public health education without imposing financial barriers on the population. It becomes a space for learning, collaboration, and community health promotion.

At the same time, we aim to develop ethical mechanisms for encouraging clients to anonymously share their medical experiences. When combined with moderated professional commentary, these anonymised cases can serve as powerful educational tools for the broader community, helping raise health literacy while maintaining strong privacy and ethical safeguards.
